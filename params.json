(optional if you only work on CAEN)\r\n6. make sure you have git installed  \r\n\t* `git --version` will give you a version number if you do\r\n\t* if you don't, [go here](http://git-scm.com/)\r\n6. clone your new repo to your local machine in a sensible directory  \r\n\t`git clone uniqname@login.engin.umich.edu:~/.git/eecs280/proj1`\r\n7. open the new folder and add your project files (or some blank test file)\r\n8. type `git commit -am \"initial commit\"` to commit your changes\r\n9. then type `git push origin master` to send them to the server\r\n\t* you'll only have to type `origin master` once to let your machine know to create the `master` branch on the remote repo\r\n10. log back into CAEN and go to your regular project files (not the ones in `.git`) use `git pull` to pull the changes you made on your local machine.\r\n\r\n\t* it is important to note that you have to `pull` and `push` on your own even if your on CAEN. when you push to CAEN you're pushing to the hidden remote repo in `.git/` not to your regular file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### *now you're setup!*\r\n\r\none of the best reasons to use `git` is for the ability to create branches of your code and revert to old versions if you make a mistake - more on this later! (or serach \"git tutorial\" on google)\r\n\r\n## git glossary\r\n* `repo` or `repository`: where `git` stores your files, really just a folder.\r\n* `git clone`: the process of copying a repo, locally or to a different machine\r\n* `git add`: add changes to the stage of next commit\r\n* `git commit`: add changes to your project. each snapshot is a called a `commit`\r\n* `git commit -am \"[message]\"`: shorthand to add all changes and commit with a message\r\n* `git pull`: pull changes from a repo (used after you've run `clone`)\r\n* `git push`: push changes to a repo\r\n","google":"UA-38012039-1"}
